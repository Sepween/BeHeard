## 🌟 About the Project

**BeHeard** is an innovative iOS application that bridges the communication gap between sign language users and the hearing world. Using cutting-edge machine learning and computer vision, it translates American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into real-time, human-readable text, making conversations more accessible and inclusive.

### What Inspired Us

The inspiration for BeHeard came from a simple yet profound realization: **communication should never be a barrier**. In a world where technology connects billions of people, the deaf and hard-of-hearing community often faces significant challenges in daily communication. 

We were moved by stories of:
- Deaf individuals struggling to communicate in emergency situations
- Students missing out on classroom discussions due to lack of interpreters
- Families wanting to learn sign language but finding it difficult to practice
- The isolation that comes from communication barriers in social settings

Our goal was to create a tool that would make sign language recognition as seamless as voice-to-text, empowering the deaf community and fostering greater inclusion.
